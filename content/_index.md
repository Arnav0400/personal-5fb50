    title: About
    content: "I am an Integrated Masters Student in Mathematics And Computing at Indian Institute Of Technology\_[IIT-ISM](https://www.iitism.ac.in/), Dhanbad, India. The objective of my research is to make machine learning much more efficient by building efficient systems. To that end, I develop novel, highly competent machine learning models, derive efficient inference algorithms and apply these to different tasks. I consider several application domains: meta-learning, bio-medical imaging, and general vision tasks.\n\nI love to participate in Kaggle competitions and explore the rapid development of deep learning in other fields in my free time. Recently, I became a\_[**Kaggle Competitions Master**](https://www.kaggle.com/carnav0400). When Iâ€™m not involved in any coding related stuff, I love to play games and browse through development in other tech-fields.\n"
